\section{CONCLUSIONS}
A method is presented to include modulations caused by turbulence in an auralisation.
The model is based on a simple theory assuming a Gaussian spectrum. The saturation of log-amplitude fluctuations is explicitly included in the model.
Future work includes comparisons with time-domain simulations of sound propagation through a turbulent atmosphere.
