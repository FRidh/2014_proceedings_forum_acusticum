abstract = {The aim of this book is to provide a set of tools for users of state-of-the-art signal processing technology and a solid foundation for those hoping to advance the the- ory and practice of signal processing. Many of the results and techniques presented here, while rooted in classic Fourier techniques for signal representation, first ap- peared during a flurry of activity in the 1980s and 1990s. New constructions for local Fourier transforms and orthonormal wavelet bases during that period weremo- tivated both by theoretical interest and by applications, in particular in multimedia communications. New bases with specified time–frequency behavior were found, with impact well beyond the original fields of application. Areas as diverse as com- puter graphics and numerical analysis embraced some of the new constructions—no surprise given the pervasive role of Fourier analysis in science and engineering. Now that the dust has settled, some of what was new and esoteric is now fundamental. Our motivation is to bring these new fundamentals to a broader audience to further expand their impact. We thus provide an integrated view of classical Fourier analysis of signals and systems alongside structured representations with time–frequency locality and their myriad of applications.},

abstract = {All aircraft noise calculation programs need a data base on aircraft sound emission. The time-step program FLULA2 used in Switzerland requires directivity information not available in the Noise-Power-Distance tables (NPD) used in many programs. Thus, an independent data base has been established for a great number of aircraft types on the basis of measurements in the close vicinity of airports. This measurement procedure has proven to yield accurate and reliable departure (initial climb) and final approach directivities. However, changes in flight configuration, i.e., aeroplane configuration plus flight parameters such as power setting, taking place during different stages of flight are modelled so far with relatively rudimentary overall sound level differences. In this paper a brief review of the state of the art of aircraft noise measurements and analysis is given for two- or three-dimensional sound source data. On the basis of typical results, advantages and limitations of the existing acquisition process for sound source data used in Switzerland are discussed and requirements for measurement procedures for next generation aircraft sound source models are identified. Based on these considerations a concept to derive spectral three-dimensional sound directivity patterns in dependence of flight configuration is presented. © European Acoustics Association.},

abstract = {Aircraft noise annoyance predictions based on traditional tools lack fidelity when modelling a single aircraft flyover. For evaluating annoyance of new procedures, different aircraft types or changing atmospheric conditions, a new modelling approach is necessary. A research effort has been initiated to develop a toolchain that links each of the relevant components. This allows the use of synthesized sound in a virtual reality simulator and enhances follow-up annoyance investigations. The toolchain components and current capabilities are presented in this paper. Audible results are illustrated by spectrograms to show the difference between different atmospheric conditions. Through the development of the toolchain, it becomes possible to demonstrate audible results of changing aircraft procedures, type and atmosphere in a virtual reality environment. This opens new ways to investigate how people value aircraft noise in different atmospheres in combination with smart planning of aircraft procedures.},

abstract = {The mean sound levels resulting from the interference between direct waves and those reflected from the ground are strongly influenced, especially at frequencies near interference minima, by fluctuations in phase and amplitude of the soundwaves induced by propagation through atmospheric turbulence. Since it was found experimentally that the correlation length (∠1.1 m) of the meteorological fluctuations is comparable to the separation between the interfering sound paths, previous theoretical work by Ingard and Maling [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 35, 1056–1058 (1963)] has been extended to allow for partial covariance between the two waves. The theory has been further extended to use the calculations of fluctuations in phase and amplitude of spherical waves, and to include the explicit calculation of the fluctuating acoustical index of refraction from the fluctuating values of temperature and wind velocity.Measurements (1–6 kHz) have been made of the interference spectrum at 15, 30, and 45 m from a point source 1.2 m above a large asphalt surface. Simultaneously, the fluctuating values of temperature and horizontal wind velocity(atmospheric turbulence) were measured at two related points close to the sound path. There is satisfactory quantitative agreement between the sound levels calculated from the measuredfluctuating meteorological variables (with one adjustable parameter) and those measured experimentally.},

abstract = {Line-of-sight measurements of the log-amplitude and phase fluctuations of pure tones between 250 and 4000 Hz propagated over distances between 2 and 300 m in the turbulent atmosphere close to the ground are compared quantitatively with simple theory using simultaneously measured meteorological variables. The theory is based on the assumption of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence and approximates the availability of eddy sizes in the source region of turbulence by a Gaussian spectrum. In particular, the transverse or mutual coherence function and the coherence in the direction of propagation (longitudinal coherence) are also calculated and compared with the measurements. When the measured mean square phase fluctuations are compared with the theory using the meteorological measurements, good agreement is obtained. However the measured mean square log-amplitude fluctuations are in general substantially smaller than predicted and, in addition, show clear evidence of saturation. The distance to saturation is shown to correspond to the longitudinal coherence length. Because of this behavior of the amplitude fluctuations, both the transverse and longitudinal coherences are essentially a function of the phase variance only.},

abstract = {The paper describes the results of a preparatory study for the planned introduction of a harmonised method to assess long-term sound levels in Europe. The purpose of this study is to quantify the error in the prediction of long-term sound levels when propagation calculations refer to a limited number of between 1 and 121 representative meteorological situations. This error is determined with respect to the average sound level resulting from parabolic-equation simulations for 1452 meteorological situations of consecutive 6-h intervals during one year. The meteorological situations were taken from meteorological tower measurements at Garching near Munich, Germany. The various meteorological conditions enter the model through two-parameter logarithmic–linear vertical profiles of the effective speed of sound which were fitted to the tower measurements. While source power and ground impedance were held constant, the model results elucidate the sound level variations due to the meteorological variability. A spread of 18 dB was found in the calculated instantaneous levels at 200 m range for rigid ground. The spread was 42 dB at 1000 m. Because of the asymmetric frequency distribution of wind directions, a spread of still up to 5.5 dB was found in the calculated annual average levels at 1000 m range for various directions of propagation. As a consequence of the specific meteorological conditions the annual average night-time level exceeds the annual average day-time level by up to 5 dB. Only 25 logarithmic–linear profile classes are necessary to determine the long-term average sound level at 1000 m range with an accuracy better than 2 dB. The use of purely linear profile classes slightly impairs the results, whereas the use of purely logarithmic profile classes cannot be recommended.},

A historical overview of investigations of the effect of atmospheric turbulence on sound propagation is presented, with an emphasis on the research carried out in Russia simultaneously with the creation of the Kolmogorov–Obukhov theory of locally homogenous and locally isotropic turbulence. The main theoretical and experimental results on acoustic wave fluctuations and scattering, which were obtained on the basis of the classic Kolmogorov–Obukhov theory, are summarized. Departures of the real atmospheric turbulence from the classic model and present-day conceptions of turbulence are discussed briefly. Some results of the current experimental study of sonic and infrasonic wave propagation in the atmospheric boundary layer and in the middle atmosphere are presented. It is shown that the peculiarities of the real atmospheric tur...},

abstract = {Landscape pattern has long been hypothesized to influence automobile dependency. Because choices about land development tend to have long-lasting impacts that span over decades, understanding the magnitude of this influence is critical to the design of policies to reduce emissions and other negative externalities associated with car use. Combining household survey data from Germany with satellite imagery and other geo-referenced data sources, we undertake an econometric analysis of the relation between landscape pattern and automobile dependency. Specifically, we employ a two-part model to investigate two dimensions of car use, the discrete decision to own a car and, conditional upon ownership, the continuous decision of how far to drive. Results indicate that landscape pattern, as captured by measures of both land cover (e.g. the extent of open space and landscape diversity) and land use (e.g. the density of regional businesses) are important predictors of car ownership and use. Other policy-relevant variables, such as fuel prices and public transit infrastructure, are also identified as correlates. Based on the magnitude of our estimates, we conclude that carefully considered land development and zoning measures – ones that encourage dense development, diverse land cover and mixed land use – can have beneficial impacts in reducing car dependency that extend far into the future.},

abstract = {The “Galileo Galilei” airport is a civil and military airport quite close to central Pisa. Although the airport brings benefits in terms of tourism and different types of income, the air traffic growth exacerbates the exposition to aircraft noise. This could significantly affect public health. To this day, a small number of studies takes into account the standard indicators of Europe by considering noise emission data for military aircrafts. We estimated the noise impact produced by the airport and we evaluated the related exposed population by using the Integrated Noise Model (INM). The noise power levels of both commercial and military flights have been considered as an input to the model. Predicted levels were validated by means of a noise-monitoring network. A new tracking system (AirNav Radar) that captures Automatic Identification System (AIS) signals emitted by each aircraft has been used to emulate takeoff and landing procedures. This improves the accuracy of the input to the model. We simulated noise maps for present and future scenarios, including those following the application of noise reduction measures. For each situation, we also estimated the exposure of the population and the percentages of highly annoyed and highly sleep disturbed people. We show the utility of AIS data and their specific elaboration to draw up noise abatement measures in order to reduce the noise impact on population and allow the airport development.},

abstract = {We present a model of the distribution of noise annoyance with the mean varying as a function of the noise exposure. Day-night level (DNL) and day-evening-night level (DENL) were used as noise descriptors. Because the entire annoyance distribution has been modeled, any annoyance measure that summarizes this distribution can be calculated from the model. We fitted the model to data from noise annoyance studies for aircraft, road traffic, and railways separately. Polynomial approximations of relationships implied by the model for the combinations of the following exposure and annoyance measures are presented: DNL or DENL, and percentage "highly annoyed" (cutoff at 72 on a scale of 0-100), percentage "annoyed" (cutoff at 50 on a scale of 0-100), or percentage (at least) "a little annoyed" (cutoff at 28 on a scale of 0-100). These approximations are very good, and they are easier to use for practical calculations than the model itself, because the model involves a normal distribution. Our results are based on the same data set that was used earlier to establish relationships between DNL and percentage highly annoyed. In this paper we provide better estimates of the confidence intervals due to the improved model of the relationship between annoyance and noise exposure. Moreover, relationships using descriptors other than DNL and percentage highly annoyed, which are presented here, have not been established earlier on the basis of a large dataset.},

abstract = {A study was conducted to examine the influence of changes in tonalness on annoyance ratings of aircraft noise. Stimuli used in this study were simulated using a program in which aircraft noise was decomposed into noise and tonal components. From these base components, additional aircraft sounds were created by varying the amplitude of the tonal components in a controlled manner while leaving the other sound attributes relatively unaffected. Two sets of 11 stimuli were generated based on a recording of a flyover after take-off event of an Airbus-310 aircraft. In Set A, tonalness was varied while loudness was kept nearly constant. In Set B, both tonalness and loudness were varied. Forty subjects aged between 19 to 33 years from a university population were recruited for this test. In the test, subjects rated the two sets of stimuli on an annoyance scale. Tonalness of these sounds, as predicted by using Aures' Tonality model, ranged from 0.01 to 0.40. The range was little broader than the range we found in a set of around 40 aircraft recordings around two Florida airports. Many of the subjects were found to be sensitive to tonalness changes. In Set A when only the tonalness was increased, a significant increase in annoyance ratings was observed. It was also found that the loudness influenced the annoyance ratings significantly, when both tonalness and loudness were varied, but that tonalness still influenced the ratings. Average annoyance ratings were highly correlated to metrics that take into account both tonalness and level. It appears from the results that inclusion of tonalness in environmental noise metrics should be considered, but that large-scale community surveys including noise measurements should be conducted to determine the form that the tonalness-level metric should take.},

abstract = {Auralization is the process of making audible the acoustics of complex virtual architectural spaces in a realistic and accurate manner. This paper presents a novel real-time auralization software environment comprising a room acoustic modeler, a spatial renderer for auralization, and a visualization and scene graph unit for interactivity. The computation of early reflection paths within the geometric model is based on an efficient beam tracing algorithm capable of real-time detection of specular reflection paths in a static geometry with one or several moving listener(s). For "simple" rooms, the real-time performance is maintained even with dynamic geometries and sources. Results of the room acoustic model consisting of visible reflection paths and their accumulated material attenuation are sent to the audio renderer. From this geometrical and acoustical data, listener position-relative 3D room impulse responses are generated using a higher-order Ambisonics approach. Finally, the spatialized audio output is presented to the listener via multiple loudspeakers or binaurally rendered over headphones. As higher order reflections are more diffuse in nature, they are encoded using lower Ambisonic orders, thereby reducing computational load. The environment combines high quality audio with visual rendering realized using the open source platforms Pure Data and VirChor respectively. This open source auralization framework provides direct audio-visual interaction in real-time and is suitable for VR environments.},

abstract = {A k-space method for large-scale simulation of ultrasonic pulse propagation is presented. The present method, which solves the coupled first-order differential equations for wave propagation in inhomogeneous media, is derived in a simple form analogous to previous finite-difference methods with staggered spatial and temporal grids. Like k-space methods based on second-order wave equations, the present method is exact for homogeneous media, unconditionally stable for "slow" [c(r) < or = c0] media, and highly accurate for general weakly scattering media. In addition, unlike previous k-space methods, the form of the method allows straightforward inclusion of relaxation absorption and perfectly matched layer (PML) nonreflecting boundary conditions. Numerical examples illustrate the capabilities of the present k-space method. For weakly inhomogeneous media, accurate results are obtained using coarser temporal and spatial steps than possible with comparable finite-difference and pseudospectral methods. The low dispersion of the k-space method allows accurate representation of frequency-dependent attenuation and phase velocity associated with relaxation absorption. A technique for reduction of Gibbs phenomenon artifacts, in which compressibility and exponentially scaled density functions are smoothed by half-band filtering, is introduced. When employed together with this smoothing technique, the k-space method provides high accuracy for media including discontinuities, high-contrast inhomogeneities, and scattering structures smaller than the spatial grid resolution.},

abstract = {Some issues regarding atmospheric turbulence modeling and its role in acoustic scattering calculations are discussed. Discrepancies between turbulence spectral models appearing in the acoustical and in the atmospheric sciences literature are noted, and it is argued that these discrepancies can be understood by recognizing that the acoustic wavelength and scattering geometry combine to act as an “acoustic filter” which selects a specific part of the turbulence spectrum. A particular model spectrum can yield satisfactory acoustic scattering predictions if it fits the actual spectrum well at the acoustically filtered turbulence scales, even if the model is a poor overall representation of the turbulence spectrum. Proper interpretation of length scales determined by fitting two-point correlation functions, and the importance of averaging times in estimating variances, are also discussed in relation to the action of the acoustic filter.},

Spectral measurements in a rigid and an acoustically lined inlet duct have been compared. Also these measurements have been utilized to assess a buzz-saw noise prediction method. The prediction method is based on a one-dimensional nonlinear propagation model. Sound absorption by an acoustic lining can be included in the model. In this article, the buzz-saw noise prediction method is improved by the inclusion in the modelling of the effect of a boundary layer on absorption of sound in a lined duct. Also, modal measurements from a circumferential microphone array have been examined. These show that the principal source of buzz-saw noise is not always the rotor-alone pressure field. Non-rotor-alone scattered tones can be a significant source of buzz-saw noise at low supersonic fan speeds. The numerical simulations, which only predict the rotor-alone tones, have been re-evaluated in light of these new modal measurements.},

They are also straightforward to encode numerically, making them appealing as a general tool. The rationale behind k-space methods and the k-space approach to the numerical modeling of photoacoustic waves in fluids are covered in this paper. Three existing k-space models are applied to photoacoustics and demonstrated with examples: an exact model for homogeneous media, a second-order model that can take into account heterogeneous media, and a first-order model that can incorporate absorbing boundary conditions.},

abstract = {The Fourier pseudospectral time-domain (PSTD) method is an attractive method to efficiently model wave propagation through a weakly inhomogeneous fluid medium. The method fails, however, for fluid media with discontinuous properties. This failure is due to the well known Gibbs phenomenon which arises when Fourier transforming a discontinuous function. The extended Fourier PSTD method developed here can accurately and efficiently model wave propagation through weakly inhomogeneous fluid media with discontinuities in the media properties. Rather than using Fourier transforms to calculate the spatial derivatives in the wave equation, the method developed here uses a generalized eigenfunction expansion for which no Gibbs phenomenon arises. Two approaches to solving the resulting time-domain problem are explored and the accuracy of the method is demonstrated. Finally, results from an example calculation of transmission through the water-air interface are shown. © 2010 IMACS.},

@article{Mast2001,
abstract = {Large-scale simulation of ultrasonic pulse propagation in inhomogeneous tissue is important for the study of ultrasound-tissue interaction as well as for development of new imaging methods. Typical scales of interest span hundreds of wavelengths; most current two-dimensional methods, such as finite-difference and finite-element methods, are unable to compute propagation on this scale with the efficiency needed for imaging studies. Furthermore, for most available methods of simulating ultrasonic propagation, large-scale, three-dimensional computations of ultrasonic scattering are infeasible. Some of these difficulties have been overcome by previous pseudospectral and k-space methods, which allow substantial portions of the necessary computations to be executed using fast Fourier transforms. This paper presents a simplified derivation of the k-space method for a medium of variable sound speed and density; the derivation clearly shows the relationship of this k-space method to both past k-space methods and pseudospectral methods. In the present method, the spatial differential equations are solved by a simple Fourier transform method, and temporal iteration is performed using a k-t space propagator. The temporal iteration procedure is shown to be exact for homogeneous media, unconditionally stable for "slow" (c(x) < or = c0) media, and highly accurate for general weakly scattering media. The applicability of the k-space method to large-scale soft tissue modeling is shown by simulating two-dimensional propagation of an incident plane wave through several tissue-mimicking cylinders as well as a model chest wall cross section. A three-dimensional implementation of the k-space method is also employed for the example problem of propagation through a tissue-mimicking sphere. Numerical results indicate that the k-space method is accurate for large-scale soft tissue computations with much greater efficiency than that of an analogous leapfrog pseudospectral method or a 2-4 finite difference time-domain method. However, numerical results also indicate that the k-space method is less accurate than the finite-difference method for a high contrast scatterer with bone-like properties, although qualitative results can still be obtained by the k-space method with high efficiency. Possible extensions to the method, including representation of absorption effects, absorbing boundary conditions, elastic-wave propagation, and acoustic nonlinearity, are discussed.},

Accurate predictions of the loudness of the noise require accurate computations of sound propagation in the atmosphere. This book describes models that can be used for these computations. The models take into account complex effects of the atmosphere and the ground surface on sound waves, including the effects of wind and temperature distributions, atmospheric turbulence, irregular terrain, and noise barriers. The main text of the book focuses on physical effects in atmospheric acoustics. The effects are illustrated by many numerical examples. The main text requires a very limited mathematical background from the reader; detailed mathematical descriptions of the models, developed from the basic principles of acoustics, are presented in appendices. Models for moving media are compared with models that are based on the effective sound speed approach. Both two-dimensional models and three-dimensional models are presented. As meteorological effects play an important role in atmospheric acoustics, selected topics from boundary layer meteorology and the theory of turbulence are also presented.},
