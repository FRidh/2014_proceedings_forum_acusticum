% English Abstract:
\Englishabstract{A new tool for the auralisation of aircraft noise in an urban 
environment is in development. When listening to aircraft noise sound level 
fluctuations caused by atmospheric turbulence are clearly audible. Therefore, to 
create a realistic auralisation of aircraft noise, the influence of atmospheric turbulence on sound propagation needs 
to be included. Presented is a model in development for including fluctuations due to 
movement through a frozen turbulent atmosphere in an auralisation.

% A new tool for the auralisation of aircraft noise in an urban environment is in 
% development. When listening to aircraft noise sound level fluctuations caused by 
% atmospheric turbulence are clearly audible. Therefore, to create a realistic 
% auralisation of aircraft noise, atmospheric turbulence needs to be included.
% 
% Due to spatial inhomogeneities of the wind velocity and temperature in the 
% atmosphere acoustic scattering occurs, affecting the transfer function between 
% source and receiver. Both these inhomogeneities and the aircraft position are 
% time-dependent, and therefore the transfer function varies with time resulting 
% in the audible fluctuations. Assuming a stationary (frozen) atmosphere, the 
% movement of the aircraft alone gives rise to fluctuations.
% 
% Sound propagation of a moving source in a frozen atmosphere is simulated using a 
% k-space PSTD method. The impulse responses obtained from these simulations are 
% then used to create a simplified model describing the influence of turbulence on 
% a moving elevated source that can then be used to simulate the influence of 
% atmospheric turbulence in the auralisation of aircraft noise.
